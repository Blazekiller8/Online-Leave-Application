# Online Leave Application

## Introduction:-

This is a simple web application that is going to be made with SvelteKit primarily so that students can apply for leave through it and get it signed by 3 levels of authoritarians

## Problem Statment

Sudeep is a student of SJCE. The current leave-applying procedure involves a lot of manual work. So he decides to create leave application software to smoothen this process. Help Sudeep to create a system that validates leave forms.

## Requirements

- The system must provide a register & login facility.

- The system should be able to get input from the student and generate leave applications with the given template. (In case of Medical Leave, the relevant documents for proof should also be submitted.)

- The leave application should be validated with an E-signature at three levels - Class counselor, HOD, and Year-in-Charge.

### Brownie point
